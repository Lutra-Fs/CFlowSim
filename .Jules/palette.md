## 2024-05-23 - Accessibility Enhancement in Navigation
**Learning:** Adding `aria-pressed` to toggle buttons combined with Tailwind's `aria-pressed:` modifier (e.g., `aria-pressed:ring-2`) provides an excellent way to indicate active state for both screen readers and visual users simultaneously, without needing separate `active` classes.
**Action:** Use `aria-pressed` attributes for all toggle-style buttons in the future to solve both accessibility and visual state styling in one go.
